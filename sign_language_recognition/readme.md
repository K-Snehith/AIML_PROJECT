# Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

This project implements a real-time sign language recognition system using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow. It recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) static hand gestures (Aâ€“Z, plus 'space', 'del', and 'nothing') and converts them into corresponding text in real time.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time recognition using webcam input  
- Hand tracking using MediaPipe  
- CNN-based classification trained on the ASL Alphabet Dataset  
- Supports 29 classes (Aâ€“Z, space, del, nothing)  
- Displays predictions live on the video feed  
- Optionally forms words from letters and adds text-to-speech output  

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.9  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech, optional)

##  Dataset

- **ASL Alphabet Dataset**  
- Training Folder: `asl_alphabet_train`  
- Testing Folder: `asl_alphabet_test`  
- Each class contains 3000+ labeled images (200x200 pixels)

 Train the Model


sign_language_model.h5 (model)

classes.npy (label names)

Run Real-Time Prediction

python realtime_predict.py
A webcam window will open and show real-time predictions of hand gestures.
